There is one scene at church which was hillarious. There is not swearing or anything bad,so our four year old watched it with us. I really don't like Rodrick, but the movie is about siblings coming together to get along. I think all in all it's well cast, I love mom and dad. I think it's funny to see the kid from Jessie, a lot younger, in these movies. A really funny cute movie.",supppuunppp,0.9770441651344299,0,0,0,0,2,0,0

You can hear the group mature and grow with each release. All I can say is THANK YOU to S-CLUB -7, and their agents! As for a stand out song for the CD Sunshine, all the songs are excellent. But so far the albums title track is my overall favorite so far. If you don't have this CD, you are missing some true magic.",supppppppp,0.6463091969490051,0,0,0,0,2,0,0

First, the characters are really cute, especially the sprites, and the animation and music is great. I watched a few of the old Rainbow Brite episodes on tape a few years back, but I think the movie is much better! My little brother saw it last week, and he's totally for it!

That said, I was leary of buying the new album based solely on the one song that I had heard (ie ""Bent""). I loved this particular song, but wasn't sure how I would feel about the rest of the album. I bought the cd anyway, and I am NOT disappointed. I have completely fallen for this album, and it will be permanently placed among my most listened to cd's. The album starts a bit slow, but by track number 5 things really pick up and the album is one hit after another at that point. My favorites are, If You're Gone, Mad Season, The Burn, Bent, Leave and Stop. You can not go wrong with buying this cd, I guarantee there will be at least two songs that will touch you and catch your mind as well as your ear.",snnupppppp,0.9721204042434692,0,0,0,0,2,0,0

An important part is played by Micheal, his youngest son, who rises in the family business at the end of the movie.. An incredible piece with kingly performances by Pacino, Brando, Caan and Robert Duvall. My favourite quote is: Michael: Sonny, its not personal, its just business.

I love the ball head and ability to use it as a tripod or monopod. Since it is light, it might not be completely stable if you have a heavy camera or lens, but you can hang ballast (such as a camera bag) to the top to give it more weight and stability.My only problem, which is why I give it only 4 stars, is that a year ago one of the joints became stuck and, after freeing it, I found that the bushing (or plastiuc washer or whatever) had become torn, which makes that one leg a little less stable. It still works, but I am more careful.Given the many years of service it has given me, this is a great and innovative product.",spppup,0.958052396774292,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
