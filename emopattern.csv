The desperate, consuming mood of ""One Step Up"" is one that most people who have suffered through a dying relationship can relate to. ""Brilliant Disguise"" & ""Tunnel of Love"" are some of the best lyrics he's ever penned. They both cut like a knife. But just when you think he's lost all sight of redemption he ends the album with the hopeful ""Valentine's Day"" where he reminds us all of what is really important in life.

The songs ""Dream On"", ""I Feel Love"" and ""I Am You"" are the only tracks worth hearing in my opinion. I keep hearing all the talk of David Gahan's drug problem being a reason for bad work in the past. Well, with Exciter, I suggest you get back on the drugs if that's what it takes to produce good work!My amazement is that you can find many ""Exciter"" Bonus tracks on the internet that I haven't been able to find on the cd. And everyone of those Bonus Tracks is twice as good as what the group choose to put on their album. The guys definitely got the good and bad mixed up when deciding on which tracks to include with this release. Check out the bonus tracks on the net.

I got it yesterday, blew it up in a few minutes, and sat on it (hesitantly at first) for over an hour. Then worked out for about an hour. It seems very durable and able to maintain my weight without a problem. The exercises on this thing are super effective, as I can feel today. The ball is just right as far as size goes.Someone complained about the pump, but I found it efficient. It's like a huge syringe. It worked fine. It only took me a few minutes to pump the ball up and that was with my one year old hanging on me so he could mess with the ball.If something happens and this product fails in some way, I will immediately update this review so that anyone who's concerned can know.

2482768,2482768,1,"This book was definetly one of the best books I've ever read, and I strongly recommend it. It was so true when Khalid said of Irene, but it applies to every American, she has an inborn, cultural arrogance that makes her blindto other ways of acting,perceiving, thinking about the world.This explains the bumper stickers, Proud to be an American and flags everywhere. Americans don't see the pain they are causing because they are all blind with arrogance. I learned, and laughed and cried from this book! It was hard to put down and I hated to finish reading it, I wanted it to go on but I would like to see Israel end it's occupation of Palestine!",spnnpn,-0.9211249947547913,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Maybe it is only me, but a number of times I have worked hours on a document and stored it. Then when I hotsych to my computer, the file is lost and does not show up on my PC either. I only get an indicator on my Visor saying that the file contents are not there. Imagine the frustration and wasted time. I am a proficient computer user. I write macros, manage a website, and am starting to learn PHP, but I haven't been able to resolve this problem. Perhaps there is a way around the problem but unless you are prepared to sink a lot of time figuring it out, be forewarned of this.",suuunnnpnn,-0.7257083058357239,0,1,0,0,0,1,1

2549551,2549551,1,"I admit I have a makeup obsession, eyeshadow and lipstick in every shade, eyelashes, all of it. I tried this little gem after seeing reviews on it. Love that I am using less of my foundation, saving me $$. It gives a air brushed look to my face. It can be a little tricky at first so definately watch the tutorial video on their web site, huge help. Also don't use it for the first time before work or if your in a time crunch, once you get rhythm down your fine. My only problem with it is it leaves little specks of foam on my face. Easily wiped of with the hand but annoying and the reason for the 4 stars. Still not annoying enough that I stop using it daily. Two tips: squeezing out less water makes it great for a sheer summer coverage. I use j&j baby wash to clean my makeup sponge and brushes. Works great, gentle and less $$$ than the brand cleanser.",spppnpunnnpup,0.937381386756897,1,0,0,0,1,1,1

They sound great live, and on that note, if anyone was wondering, the unlisted tracks are live and I will list them for anyone that is interested.18. the poet you never were (live)19. ariadne's friend (live)20. notres langues nous trompent (live)21. the sweetness and the light (live)22. endymion (live)well, that is that.adios-brian",sppnpu,0.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
20646,20646,1,"I bought this CD because I read on this web page that this was the best selling CD and there was a lot of good reviews. I have never bought or really heard Moby before but I have read some interesting stuff about him. Right away I recognized a couple of songs. I noticed when browsing for some new techno that many people who bought the CDs I did, also bought this one. My friend told me ""its kinda slow at first so give it a listen to"". Personally I like the first few songs the best. They are worth the price of the CD. I think the end gets a little slow. Good sound on this recording - excellent production from beginning to end! Good music to get the ladys dancing. Good music to chill with your woman (like smoke some hoochy and get your groove on, ya know what I'm sayin?) then after y'all have been at it for a while, the end kinda mellows out as you smoke your last cigarette and go to sleep. I want to buy some more Moby!",sppuuuppnpppup,0.7592889070510864,1,0,0,0,1,0,1

It'll keep you interested for about the first 45 minutes. After that I become distracted by the endless closeups (full-face, profile, eyes only, mouth only, top of head, hands) and pained expressions which substituted for meaningful dialogue. Frankly, my mind began to wander..wondering why Redford didn't stay out of the sun in his youth, why Dafoe's skin is beginning to look like linoleum, why there was only that one shot of the dog, why Helen Mirren would sign on for such tripe. I'm giving it 2 stars for the actor playing the detective. He was good. His assistant had one line. I'm always curious about such shenanigans.",sunpnnppuu,0.0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
