Some say that if you don't 'get it' you're just too young, while others say you're just too old. I think the main problem with this movie is that people watch movies to be entertained. If I wanted to experience 'real life' I would read a newspaper or watch the news. (Don't even get me started on reality tv). People can take this movie and twist it into whatever they want it to mean for them, but in the end it's just a depressing story with badly developed characters.

Lenin demonstrates that he has little of the flair of a born philosopher but the heavyhandedness and arbitrariness of a politician. This book, which is so antiquated that it now seems unworthy of even academic interest, is nothing but a compilation of quatations from previous Marxists, glossed and re-worked to back up official party policy. Also includes a typically stupid and blustering polemic against the majority of positivists and idealists who are all deemed as ""blockheads""; only the revelations of Marx and Engels, as Lenin seems to think, contain the monopoly of infallible truth. A laughable example of the dogmatism and intolerance of an ideology upon which was founded a totalitarian darkness that could not maintain itself without resorting to terror, persecution, assassination, sabotage and institutionalised ignorance.",snnnnnn,-0.9287927150726318,0,0,0,0,0,2,0

Really, his books are horrible. I read both of his bestsellers because they got such good reviews, but both times, I was severly disappointed. Reading an Albom book is like watching an After School Special or reading a Chicken Soup for the Soul book--he attempts to affect your emotions by using the most direct (non-creative), simple (non-intellectual) story lines, rather than being a truly creative author by making you react emotionally without having to shove the simpleton feel-good drivel down your throat. The onely good thing I can say about Albom's books--they're very short.",snnnnnp,0.9226349592208862,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

932563,932563,1,"Oh my goodness. It must be a crime to love an inanimate object so much. I have been suffering with a poor decision made years ago to purchase an under the cabinet Black & Decker can opener that loved to disperse the contents of the can on the counter. It finally started cutting so poorly that my depression era mentality allowed me to replace it. The West Bend arrived yesterday, right before I was ready to open three cans. It got the acid test with a 28-ounce can of enchilada sauce (okay, some of us have to have help). It didn't spill a drop. It's tall (allow 10 and a half inches) but doesn't take up that much length and width space (5 x 5 inches) on the counter. They also had me with the 70 watt motor and detachable head going in the dishwasher. Nosing around, Amazon had this in their Warehouse Deals section, where the box was supposed to be damaged (but it wasn't), and so the price was only $17.99 (new item with warranty) including super saver shipping (at $25 for total purchases).",spnnnuuuuuu,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

This score, however, does nothing of the sort. It is trite, distracting, rambling, disjointed, and ugly. The use of several poorly-generated synthesized sounds in the orchestration highlight Mr. Morricone's lack of compositional ability.This score performs poorly in the theater because it has no musical value.

I'm sending it in and getting my money back.)To be honest, I didn't even finish the book. Around 40 pages from the end I decided I was wasting my time, since it wasn't entertaining anymore.

Those who try to have these accepted as norms, inevitably have their ideals lampooned when it's shown that they're impossible to attain or sustain. Thus we have Limbaugh's drug addiction, Bennett's gambling habit, priestly buggery, etc.Hertzberg and his ilk never fail to use the weight of the fallen idealist to smash the moral underpinnigs of society. This is flawed logic. It will never work, not as long as there are good people and people to aspire to be good. What's the alternative?

Despite lacking heavy industry, Dresden was a regional capital, a communications center, etc., and therefore a legitimate target. As for the destruction of cultural treasures, the Germans merely got a taste of their own medicine. After the Warsaw Uprising, German crews with flamethrowers systematically burned Warsaw's archives and libraries, causing the loss of a half-million irreplaceable pieces of literature. The Germans also deliberately dynamited architectural buildings (among them the Royal Castle of Warsaw). The list goes on and on. So, although not done for this reason, this destruction of the loveliest of German cities was a fitting payback to the Germans.",spnunnnnn,-0.7204368710517883,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
